Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Eduardo,

I am writing to you from a brazen spaceship in a scrumptious galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in march. There are 789,152 puppies and kids of coffee here! In the
living room there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
